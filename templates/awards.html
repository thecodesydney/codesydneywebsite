            "This has been the second time that Deadly Connections have engaged
            Code.Sydney on an IT project. The first was when I requested them to
            develop a landing page as an interim while waiting for the full
            website. Even though Code.Sydney are a volunteer group of developers,
            their dedication to the satisfactory completion of their projects is
            undertaken with the utmost professionalism. <br />
            Code.Sydney kept me updated every step of the way ensuring that every
            detail is followed and well-executed. Another key differentiator is
            their level of support after going live, they are always ready to
            answer our call when help is needed and a regular monthly report of
            website activities is being generated which can help us determine
            future improvements."

            PropertyExtractor project. It has been a pleasure working with him
            throughout the journey. He is very responsive and always helpful from
            prototyping until final delivery. I learnt that he is one of the best
            mentors in Code.Sydney. <br />
            Above all, I am most grateful for Kevin’s initiative and guidance to
            successfully develop a working prototype that my stakeholders are
            happy to use hence allowing my project to proceed to the next stage.
            May Code.Sydney and Kevin keep up the good work!"

            "Talking Time with Lukas and Alicia is a podcast show being run by volunteers. 
            We didn’t have the time or know how to produce a quality website or way for people 
            to get in contact with us. Coming to our rescue was Engamar Bollas and Stephen Melben Corral from Code.Sydney. 
            Even though Code.Sydney is a volunteer group of web developers, the way they steered 
            us through the process of developing and setting up a website for our show, was second to none. 
            With constant communication, advice and expert direction we decided upon the functionality 
            we needed, the features we required and what access we and our listeners needed. The friendly and 
            personalised nature of the Code.Sydney team would make us recommend their work to any other 
            Not For profit or volunteer group. We can not thank Code.Sydney enough and hope to work with them 
            again soon as we continue to grow. "
