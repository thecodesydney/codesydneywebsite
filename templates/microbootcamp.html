<p style = "margin: 30px">We are a believer of freeCodeCamp.org hence this micro bootcamp will be anchored to the first 2 sections of freeCodeCamp curriculum. In fact, if you are self-driven, we highly recommend that you just go through freeCodeCamp.org yourself and just join our slack channel like other self-driven learners.
However, if you need someone to push you, then this micro bootcamp is for you. We will also ensure that there will be regular class zoom meetings (ie. Mon/Wed/Fri) to share our progress and any roadblocks along the way. At the end of the course, we will also introduce you to GitHub to learn how to build a project within a team environment.
