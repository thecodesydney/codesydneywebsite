          "This has been the second time that Deadly Connections have engaged
          Code.Sydney on an IT project. The first was when I requested them to
          develop a landing page as an interim while waiting for the full
          website. Even though Code.Sydney are a volunteer group of developers,
          their dedication to the satisfactory completion of their projects is
          undertaken with the utmost professionalism. <br />
          Code.Sydney kept me updated every step of the way ensuring that every
          detail is followed and well-executed. Another key differentiator is
          their level of support after going live, they are always ready to
          answer our call when help is needed and a regular monthly report of
          website activities is being generated which can help us determine
          future improvements."

          "Thank you, Code.Sydney for recommending Kevin Foong to work on the
          PropertyExtractor project. It has been a pleasure working with him
          throughout the journey. He is very responsive and always helpful from
          prototyping until final delivery. I learnt that he is one of the best
          mentors in Code.Sydney. <br />
          Above all, I am most grateful for Kevin’s initiative and guidance to
          successfully develop a working prototype that my stakeholders are
          happy to use hence allowing my project to proceed to the next stage.
          May Code.Sydney and Kevin keep up the good work!"

          "Highly Recommended. Take it from me, I have a dozen uncompleted Udemy
          Python & Flask courses sitting on my laptop. This course takes you
          from Python basics to a published web app in 5 weeks in a supportive
          and collaborative small group with two amazing mentors. The two
          mentors are always on hand to help and offer insights from their own
          vast industry experience - priceless!"

          "I went in this course looking for a solid introduction to Flask. This
          course delivered that and much, much, more. The mentors were very
          generous in sharing their experience in the end to end development of
          a Web app, and I left with a portfolio project hosted in the cloud,
          and the opportunity to apply these skills to well managed projects. So
          a big thankyou to Code.Sydney for providing this extremely valuable
          course!"

          "This course was a great introduction to Python and Flask - getting
          you to a point where you can code a basic web app. It also paves the
          way for further learning. The face to face meet ups really help and
          the support provided by the teachers is terrific - they are more
          willing to help the students when needed."

              of the process and the simple way the information and/or instructions are communicated. Code.Sydney
              assisted us in the preparation of an innovative app prototype and also a landing page. Both times, Engramar and
              the Code.Sydney team have gone above and beyond to ensure we are beyond satisfied with the outcome.
