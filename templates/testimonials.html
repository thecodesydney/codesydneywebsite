            <p class="service-text">"Highly Recommended. Take it from me, I have a dozen uncompleted Udemy Python & Flask courses
              sitting on my laptop. This course takes you from Python basics to a published web app in 5 weeks in a supportive and
              collaborative small group with two amazing mentors. The two mentors are always on hand to help and offer insights from
              their own vast industry experience - priceless!"</p>

          <div class="col-md-4 mb-4 text-center">
            <p class="service-text">"I went in this course looking for a solid introduction to Flask. This course delivered that
              and much, much, more. The mentors were very generous in sharing their experience in the end to end development of
              a Web app, and I left with a portfolio project hosted in the cloud, and the opportunity to apply these skills to
              well managed projects. So a big thankyou to Code.Sydney for providing this extremely valuable course!"</p>

            <p class="service-text">"This course was a great introduction to Python and Flask - getting you to a point where
              you can code a basic web app. It also paves the way for further learning. The face to face meet ups really help
              and the support provided by the teachers is terrific - they are more willing to help the students when needed."</p>

              The method of learning was based on practical approach so fun to go through.
              I would definitely recommend others for this course."</p>

              beginning of our professional relationship. As someone with limited I.T. skills, I can confirm the ease
              of the process and the simple way the information and/or instructions are communicated. Code.Sydney
              assisted us in the preparation of an innovative app prototype and also a landing page. Both times, Engramar and
              the Code.Sydney team have gone above and beyond to ensure we are beyond satisfied with the outcome.
              Code.Sydney will remain my go-to IT company and we canâ€™t wait to work with them on our upcoming web page."</p>
