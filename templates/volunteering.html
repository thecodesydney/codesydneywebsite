          "This has been the second time that Deadly Connections have engaged
          Code.Sydney on an IT project. The first was when I requested them to
          develop a landing page as an interim while waiting for the full
          website. Even though Code.Sydney are a volunteer group of developers,
          their dedication to the satisfactory completion of their projects is
          undertaken with the utmost professionalism. <br />
          Code.Sydney kept me updated every step of the way ensuring that every
          detail is followed and well-executed. Another key differentiator is
          their level of support after going live, they are always ready to
          answer our call when help is needed and a regular monthly report of
          website activities is being generated which can help us determine
          future improvements."

          "Thank you, Code.Sydney for recommending Kevin Foong to work on the
          PropertyExtractor project. It has been a pleasure working with him
          throughout the journey. He is very responsive and always helpful from
          prototyping until final delivery. I learnt that he is one of the best
          mentors in Code.Sydney. <br />
          Above all, I am most grateful for Kevinâ€™s initiative and guidance to
          successfully develop a working prototype that my stakeholders are
          happy to use hence allowing my project to proceed to the next stage.
          May Code.Sydney and Kevin keep up the good work!"
